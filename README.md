### Overview
ReanimateMC is a revolutionary plugin that transforms Minecraft’s conventional death system. Instead of a player dying instantly when their health reaches zero, the plugin introduces an intermediary state—KO (knockout). This innovative mechanic allows for dynamic role-play and strategic decision-making by giving players a chance to be revived by teammates or executed by adversaries. Perfect for Hardcore Survival, role-play, or tactical PVP servers, ReanimateMC injects a new level of depth into the gameplay experience.
